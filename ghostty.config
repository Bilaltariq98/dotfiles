# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /Users/bilal/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
#
# Ghostty can reload the configuration while running by using the menu
# options or the bound key (default: Command + Shift + comma on macOS and
# Control + Shift + comma on other platforms). Not all config options can be
# reloaded while running; some only apply to new windows and others may require
# a full restart to take effect.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY macos-option-as-alt: By default macOS treats Option as a compose key
# (Option+C = ç, Option+N = ñ). We need Option to act as Alt so that
# fzf's Alt-C (fuzzy cd) and Alt-Arrow (word jump) work.
# TRADEOFF: You lose the ability to type special characters (ç, ñ, etc.)
# via Option key. Use Cmd+Ctrl+Space emoji picker if you need them.
macos-option-as-alt = true

# WHY: Ctrl-Backspace doesn't send a usable signal by default. \x17 is the
# same as Ctrl-W (backward-kill-word) which zsh understands natively.
keybind = ctrl+backspace=text:\x17

# WHY: Ctrl-Arrow doesn't map to word-jump by default on macOS.
# \x1bb = ESC-b (backward-word), \x1bf = ESC-f (forward-word) in emacs mode.
# Option-Arrow also works for word jump (Ghostty default: alt+arrow=esc:b/f).
keybind = ctrl+arrow_left=text:\x1bb
keybind = ctrl+arrow_right=text:\x1bf

# WHY: Ghostty's default binds Shift+Arrow to adjust_selection (terminal-level
# text selection). We unbind these so the CSI sequences pass through to zsh,
# where we've set up shift-select on the command line (like a text editor).
# Without this, Shift+Arrow selects in the scrollback instead of on the
# current command line input.
# PAIRED WITH: Shift-select section in ~/.zshrc
keybind = shift+arrow_left=unbind
keybind = shift+arrow_right=unbind
keybind = shift+arrow_up=unbind
keybind = shift+arrow_down=unbind

# WHY: Same as above but for Shift+Option+Arrow (macOS-style word selection).
# Unbinding lets the CSI ;4 sequences reach zsh for word-by-word selection.
# PAIRED WITH: Shift-select section in ~/.zshrc (bindkey '^[[1;4C/D')
keybind = shift+alt+arrow_left=unbind
keybind = shift+alt+arrow_right=unbind
